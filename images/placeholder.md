# Image Placeholders

This file is a placeholder for the images directory. You should replace the references in the HTML with your own images.

For the website to display properly with images, you'll need to add the following images:

1. `it-portfolio.jpg` - For the IT Portfolio Management section
2. `services-delivery.jpg` - For the Services Delivery section
3. `marketing.jpg` - For the Marketing Management section
4. `collaboration.jpg` - For the Collaboration feature section
5. `security.jpg` - For the Security feature section
6. `ai-productivity.jpg` - For the AI Productivity feature section

You can also use external image services or CDNs by updating the image URLs in the HTML file.
